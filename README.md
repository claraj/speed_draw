# Hello WebSockets

Simple speed drawing app. Draw a picture in the canvas, the picture is shared between all the connected clients. But there's a timer - after 20 seconds, the drawing is cleared.

First app using sockets.io. Inspired by <a href=""> and helped out by this nice tutorial for incorporating sockets.io into an app generated by the express generator.

Clone, NPM install, and open the app in a couple of browser windows to test.
